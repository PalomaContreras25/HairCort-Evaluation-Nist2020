## Overview
This repository contains a detailed record of the analysis pipeline for measuring hair cortisol using ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay). The files within serve as documentation of the computational steps, model applications, and visualizations used to derive cortisol concentrations from hair samples, specifically for projects focusing on physiological stress measurements.

## Repository Structure
