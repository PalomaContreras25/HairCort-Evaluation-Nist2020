VALIDATION 1: Spike-Recovery Test
🎯 Purpose:
To assess how much known cortisol is recovered from a pulverized extract. This helps detect matrix interference (e.g., suppression or enhancement).

🔬 Materials:
Pulverized, washed blank hair sample (very low or no cortisol)
Cortisol standard solution (e.g., 1000 pg/mL in assay buffer)
ELISA plate with standard curve

🧪 Procedure:

| Tube |	Contents |	Description |
----------------------------------
A	| Pulverized hair + methanol (extraction only) | Unspiked control — tells you the background
B	| Pulverized hair + methanol + known cortisol (e.g., 100 pg) |	Spiked sample — checks if you recover what you added
C	| Cortisol in methanol (no hair) |	Solvent control — ensures no cortisol loss or pipetting error
Let the spiked tube sit for 30–60 min to simulate binding, then proceed with extraction and ELISA as usual.

Reconstitute the dried extract and run both A and B in duplicate on the plate.

🧮 Calculation:
Recovery (%) = 

((Measured pg − Background pg (A)) /  Spiked pg ) * 100

Recovery (%)=( 
Spiked pg
Measured pg−Background pg (A)
​
 )×100
✅ What You Want to See:
80–120% recovery is generally considered acceptable.

If <80% or >120%, matrix effects are likely.

🧪 VALIDATION 2: Parallelism Test
🎯 Purpose:
To determine whether a serial dilution of your extract runs parallel to the standard curve, indicating minimal matrix effects (no inhibition or enhancement).

✅ How to Set It Up
🔬 Materials:
A high-concentration pulverized extract (from a real or pooled sample)

Your ELISA standard curve

Assay buffer for dilution

🧪 Plate Layout Example:

Well	Dilution	Contents
Std1–Std8	—	Standard curve
S1	Neat extract	100%
S2	1:2 dilution	50%
S3	1:4 dilution	25%
S4	1:8 dilution	12.5%
S5	1:16 dilution	6.25%
...	...	(optional more dilutions)
Dilute the extract in assay buffer, not methanol!

Run all diluted samples in duplicate.

📉 Plotting & Interpreting:
Plot absorbance (y-axis) vs. log concentration (x-axis) for:

The standard curve

Your diluted extract

Check for parallelism between the sample and the standard curve.

✅ If your sample curve is parallel to the standard, no major matrix effect is present.

⚠️ If the sample curve bends or flattens relative to the standard, there's likely matrix interference.

🧪 Summary of Both Tests

Test	What It Tells You	Outcome to Look For
Spike-Recovery	Do matrix components suppress/enhance cortisol signal?	Recovery 80–120%
Parallelism	Do serial dilutions track with the standard curve?	Same shape/parallel curves
