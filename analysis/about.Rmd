- Addition (or not) of a spike using same dilution as for STD 1.


Visualizations were conducted using dataset obtained from Myassays.com, i.e. before calculating final values including weight, buffer vol, and spike. This was because I wanted to look at the general performance of the assay, as well as visualizing the influence of different parameters of interest before controlling for them.





## Sample Preparation
1. **Hair Collection**: Hair samples are collected from participants and stored in a cool, dry environment until processing.
2. **Sample Processing**: Each sample is washed, dried, and ground into a fine powder to ensure homogeneity.
3. **Cortisol Extraction**: Cortisol is extracted using methanol, following standard lab procedures to ensure consistent recovery.

## ELISA Protocol Summary
The ELISA assay is run on a microplate using a cortisol-specific antibody. Samples are prepared in multiple formats:

- **Spiked Samples**: 25 µL of a known cortisol standard is added to 25 uL of sample.
- **Non-Spiked Samples**: 50 µL of unaltered sample for actual measurement.
- **Dilution**: reconstitution using 60 uL, or using 250 uL
- **Weight**: varies between 11 and 37.1 mg (mean=23.22)

After incubation, absorbance readings are measured, and cortisol concentrations are calculated using a standard curve.

The output from the plate reader, as well as all the information to interpret it, are stored in this repository. We used the original output from Myassays as it provides a better fitting curve than one calculated manually.
